###	Our process

1. understand the project requirments
2. split the team-work
3. setup the node.js server
4. used in API via the server side by request module 
5. Write handler functions querying user input against dummy spell list
6. Connect handler functions to the server
7. Separate router and server into separate files
8. Add keyboard navigation
9. create connection between the client side to server side

### **What we struggled with**
* Filter the data from the API to what we need to present
* Transfer the data from server side to client side 
* Imoprt image for any player
* Deploy to Heruko

### **What we learned?
* What is request module and how it works
* How work with the server side and connect it to the client side
* How to modularize the router by handler file
* How to orginize the file in Folders by categories
